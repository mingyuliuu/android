# Finance Simple #

Developed during SheHacks 2021, the aim of this project is to create a seamingless yet memorable experience
equipping females, who often find finance boring and challenging, with the knowledge to better manage their financal assets.

#### The application has 3 key components:
1. A lesson hub, where users can watch videos and lecture content predesigned by professionals. There are also practice problems and interactive materials to accompany the lectures, through which users can gain Finan Dollars - the virtual currency in our app.

</p>
  
2. A virtual market, where prices of goods will fluctuate and be impacted by major world events, to simulate a real life setting. Users will be encouraged to experience and learn how to improve their financial stills by using the virtual currency they gained in a bid process.

</p>

3. We would partner with NGOs and allow users to make real life commitments to promote social and environmental sustainability. Through the "fake" currency a user earns by learning and practicing, we will help the user build an "actual" tree in a forest.
